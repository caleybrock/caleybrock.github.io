      Caley Brock is a full stack software engineer at VTS in Toronto. Her other full time software roles have been with civic & education focused non-profit organizations, but she's also worked for agencies, startups, and large tech companies through her computer science program at the University of Waterloo. She thrives when just the right amount of process, empathy, and interdisciplinary structures allow her to do technical work for thoughtful products.

      Caley is also passionate about supporting diverse and inclusive communities in software and does this through teaching workshops for novice programmers and mentoring newcomers to the industry.
