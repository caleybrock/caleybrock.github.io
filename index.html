    <h1>Hi, I'm Caley</h1>

    <p>
      I'm a full stack web developer who strives to enable teammates to be successful. I like using just the right amount of process, empathy, and interdisciplinary structures to make this happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm also passionate about supporting diverse and inclusive communities in software. I do this through teaching workshops for novice programmers and mentoring newcomers to the industry. 
    </p>

    <p>
      My latest full time roles have been with civic and education focused non-profit organizations as a software engineer, but I've also worked for agencies, startups, and large tech companies. The combination of my foundational computer science knowledge, experience with modern web technologies, and advocacy for the user, make me a strong team contributor.
